# pandas-challenge
 
On this challenge we were requested to analyse two CSV files containing data of a district-wide standardized test results, with students math and reading scores as well information about the schools they attended.

After organinzing the data, we should have bing able find some trends and correlate with school performance.

Project Overview

On this project we analysed the data from 15 district-wide high schools with their test results for math and reading. The coverage was of grades 09th to 12th and a total of 39,170 students. We also analysed the schools budgets and their investment per student as well their size. Our project team would like to remember that those indicators only can not qualify the success of a school and it's students. Another variables should be taken into consideration, but as a prelimenary analysis it is possible to have some guidelines for improvement.


Procedure

First step was cleaning and organazing the data, removing some prefixes and/or sufixes on students names, and combining the the two available data: the school data, with information about each school their name, type, size, and budget. The student data had the name of each student, gender, grade, school name, reading, and math scores.

With the data organized, it was possible to create some analysis such as:
 - Schools Average Math Score: 78.99
 - Schools Average Reading Score: 81.88
 - Math Passing Percentage: 74.98%
 - Reading Passing Percentage: 85.81%
 - Oveall Passing Percentage: 65.17%
 - Top 5 Performing Schools (By Overall Passing)
 - Bottom 5 Performing Schools (By Overall Passing)
 - Math Scores by Grade
 - REading Scores by Grade
 - Scores by School Spending
 - Scores by Scool Size
 - Scores by School Type
 
Conclusion

Even though some may think that if a school invest more money per student better will be their results, after tis data analysis is possible to conclude that is not always the case. The schools with a higher Overall Passing percentage (90%), were the ones with the lower spending range per student (<$585), against 53% of Overall Passing rates for Schoools with Spending per Students between $645-680. In the other hand, data shows that size and type has influence.

Medium and Small schools had almost the same percentage of Overall Passing rates (90.62% and 89.88% respectively). Less than one percentage point. Large schools, with more than 2,000 students had an overall pessage percentage of 58,29%.

The School Type has another significant impact in the students performance. Charter schools had a Overall Passing Percentage of 90.43% and Public with 53.67%
