# pandas-challenge
 
On this challenge we were requested to analyse two CSV files containing data of a district-wide standardized test results, with students math and reading scores as well information about the schools they attended.

After organinzing the data, we should have bing able find some trends and correlate with school performance.

Project Overview

On this project we analysed the data from 15 district-wide high schools with their test results for math and reading. The coverage was of grades 09th to 12th and a total of 39,170 students. We also analysed the schools budgets and their investment per student as well their size. Our project team would like to remember that those indicators only can not qualify the success of a school and it's students. Another variables should be taken into consideration, but as a prelimenary analysis it is possible to have some guidelines for improvement.


Procedure

First step was cleaning and organazing the data, removing some prefixes and/or sufixes on students names, and combining the the two available data: the school data, with information about each school their name, type, size, and budget. The student data had the name of each student, gender, grade, school name, reading, and math scores.
